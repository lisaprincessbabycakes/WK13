## Arduino Communication with p5.js

When I started this assignment, I had a pretty clear idea of what I wanted: interactive visuals that respond to real-time data with the potentiometer . In my head, it seemed simple enough—connect the hardware, write some code, and boom, it’s working! But the reality was way messier. The data wasn’t behaving how I expected, and I kept running into these annoying little issues that made me question everything. Is it the Arduino code? Is it the way I’m handling the input in JavaScript? I had to slow down, take it step by step, and really figure it out.


I revisited the previous assignment, HW04A, to rethink how I could approach creating the visuals for this project. That homework gave me a solid starting point and helped me understand some foundational concepts that I wanted to build on. 

At the same time, I used this week’s template as a base and expanded on it. The template provided a good structure for handling the serial data, so I didn’t have to start from scratch. Instead, I focused on layering in my own ideas—tweaking the visuals, adding new features, and refining the interactions. Combining what I learned from HW04A with the current template felt like a natural progression. It allowed me to experiment while still staying grounded in techniques I already knew.

The visuals I created in this project became this fun playground of colors and movement, and seeing them respond to the potentiometer was super satisfying.

I’ve learned that patience is everything, and honestly, Google is my best friend. Every small win, like fixing a bug or getting the data to display right, felt like a tiny victory, and those moments kept me going.

What really stood out to me while working on this is how coding isn’t just a straight path. It’s full of false starts and moments where you think you’ve got it, only to realize you don’t. But that’s okay because those moments force you to learn and get better. For me, coding feels like a constant conversation between me and the computer—trying to figure out what it’s doing and making it understand what I want it to do.
